To run our website/program please run 'node main.js' in the terminal then go to localhost:5000 to view our website

We are a group of 2, originally 4. Our third member left a few days before the deadline and our fourth member dropped out two weeks before. Our parts are the html/css/js and part sql transactions, therefore the other parts which were not originally our tasks will be a little weak so please have consideration. These parts include the ER diagram, creating the database and related tasks such as normalization, and much of the SQL code.
