To run our website/program please run 'node main.js' in the terminal then go to localhost:5000 to view our website

We are a group of 2, originally 4. Our third member left a few days before the deadline and our fourth member dropped out two weeks before. Our parts are the html/css/js and part sql transactions, therefore the other parts which were not originally our tasks will be a little weak so please have consideration. These parts include the ER diagram, creating the database and related tasks such as normalization, and much of the SQL code.

Note: 
Our demo video was recorded and website was tested on the Elephant.sql database. We attempted to transfer the data over to the main server on Angelitas account, but we ran into complications.
